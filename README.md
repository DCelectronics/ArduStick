# ArduStick
Arduino Compatible Board (ATmega 328P) for breadboards or small projects where space is limited
The J3 through J5 female sockets can be substituted (since the footprint is the same for 0.1" pin spacing) by 90 degree (horizontal) male headers if you want to plug the Ardustick directly on a breadboard.
